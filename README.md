# "Chronik der Wende"

The "Chronik der Wende" series is a TV series by German TV station RBB documenting the days and months following October 7, 1989 in Germany, both East and West. It contains 160 episodes, of about 15 minutes each, one for each day.  The first day is October 7, 1989, and the last is March 18, 1990.

Unfortunately, the DVDs (or BluRay) are no longer available for purchase. They are however available, at least at this time, through the ARD Mediathek.  From there, they can be easily downloaded via the MediathekView application. The goal of this project is to make it possible to create DVDs with comfortable menu navigation and the information that is available for each episode, via the accompanying `txt` file.

Why DVD? My parents have a DVD player (that probably also plays BluRay), and my old MacBook Pro has a DVD slot, but cannot burn BluRay disks. Both taken together make it logical to create DVDs.

In the project documentation, I try to document how the DVDs are made, especially the menus. All tools used are free and open-source: `imagemagick`, `ffmpeg`, `dvdauthor`, `spumux`. It's weird creating DVDs after all these years, today, in this world of streaming video. Discussion lists for `dvdauthor` had less than 10 contributions in the last three years, most pages I found date back 15 years or more. But it's been fund and educating to learning and understanding how a DVD is created.
